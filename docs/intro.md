# Intro of Ggivings

## Who am I
My name is Cheng, born in a small city in China(Jingde, Anhui). My family is not rich but my parents managed to have me access to all necessary education. Education helps me form the skills to make a living and an independent personality. Now I’m a software engineer in silicon valley, my compensation is not as high as those riches but is decent. I always want to do something for those who need help, especially senior people and children. Now I’m turning this idea into reality.

## What's Ggivings
Ggivings is a non-profit charitable organization founded by Cheng in 2023. The letter G is taking from my daughter Grace. It is a small organization and the fund will primarily come from Cheng’s family. We’d like to do our best, even if it is small, to help. Our focus for now are senior people who need medical care and children who need education in Jingde, Anhui. 

## Why Jingde?
* I was raised up and met my wife there, we'd like to give back to the local communities
* Our organization is small so we need to focus at some place we know best. We will extend once we get more sources.
