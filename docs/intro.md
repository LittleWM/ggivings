# Intro of GGivings

## Who am I
My name is Cheng, born in a small city in China(Jingde, Anhui). My family is not rich but my parents managed to have me access to all necessary education. Education helps me form the skills to make a living and an independent personality. Now I’m a software engineer in silicon valley, my compensation is not as high as those riches but is decent. I always want to do something for those who need help, especially senior people and children. Now I’m turning this idea into reality.

## What's GGivings
Ggivings is a non-profit charitable organization founded by Cheng in 2023. The letter G is taking from our daughter Grace. She is like a plain white paper right now and we want her to be empathetic and inclusive. We could teach her by doing.

It is a small organization and the fund will primarily come from the Cheng’s family. We’d like to do our best, even if it is small, to help. Our focus for now are senior people who need medical care and children who need education.
