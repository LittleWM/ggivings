# Scholarship Grant Guidelines
## Objective:
In compliance with local laws, regulations, and relevant United States IRS regulations, the objective is to provide financial assistance to economically disadvantaged students during their compulsory education phase.

## Selection of Awardees:

### Non-Discrimination Principle:

Awardees will be selected based on a non-discrimination principle, irrespective of their background, race, or gender.

### Nomination and Verification:

Awardees will be nominated by the school, and their eligibility will be verified by GGivings.

The criteria for eligibility include family poverty, where family income falls below the local average, risking the loss of educational opportunities, or other exceptional circumstances mutually agreed upon by the school and GGivings.

Awardees must not appear on the OFAC List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons for names of individuals and entities, and they must not demonstrate any terrorist tendencies. This is to further ensure that our support is not inadvertently directed towards individuals or entities involved in non-charitable or unlawful activities.

Regular assessments will be conducted at the beginning of each academic semester, with exceptions considered for emergency support, such as unforeseen medical expenses or family crises, to ensure students can overcome unforeseen obstacles.

## Grant Disbursement and Records:

### Types of Support:

Grants may include cash disbursements and educational materials. The cash component typically covers half of the semester's educational and meal expenses.

### Receipt Confirmation:
GGivings disburses funds to partner schools in a lump sum based on the approved list. Once the school receives the funds, they provide GGivings with a receipt for the received payment.

### Scholarship disbursement
Subsequent disbursement of cash and distribution of educational materials will be carried out by the school.

### Information and Record Submission:

The school is required to provide GGivings with information on grant recipients, including names, grade levels, and home addresses. Additionally, academic performance records must be submitted at the end of each semester.
Grant records will be kept confidential between the school and GGivings, in adherence to the principle of protecting the information of grant recipients. In special circumstances, disclosure to regulatory authorities may be considered.

## Anti-Fraud and Misuse Policy:

### Effective Verification:

Schools must conduct thorough verification of the family circumstances of nominated students to ensure eligibility.

### Consequences of Fraud or Misuse:

In cases of fraudulent documentation or misappropriation of funds, grant disbursement will be immediately terminated, and legal action may be pursued to recover misappropriated funds.


These guidelines aim to establish a transparent and accountable scholarship program that adheres to legal and regulatory requirements, ensuring that funds are directed to students in genuine need while safeguarding their privacy and preventing fraud and misuse.
